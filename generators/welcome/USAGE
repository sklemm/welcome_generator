Description:
    Stubs out a new controller and two views: index and about.
    Pass the controller name, either CamelCased or under_scored.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers, view templates in
    app/views/controller_name, no helpers, no tests, sorry for that.

Example:
    `./script/generate welcome Welcome`
